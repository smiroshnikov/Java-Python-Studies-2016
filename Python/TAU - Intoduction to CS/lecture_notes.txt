THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMPILED AND INTERPRETED - FINALLY EXPLAINED, CLEARLY !

[Interpreted] - is a machine level program , which interprets and executes the
high level language line by line . [PYTHON]
Harder to optimize, less efficient performance

[pros/cons]
Performed line by line , instruction one by one

[Compiled] - translates the "complete" high level program to ao machine level program [C,C++]
whole program is compiled and then executed. Can be much more optimized [during compilation process can evaluate and
use memory, variables , registers more efficiently. Usually will run more efficiently then interpreted program.
CPU/memory/cache usage should be fairly better.
The whole process is longer and not as INSTANT as interpreted language
